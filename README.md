# 🧰 Client Data Workbench – React Frontend for Dynamic API Data Management

A responsive, interactive **React application** that demonstrates real-world front-end development skills including API integration, dynamic rendering, and UI state management.

This project simulates a client-side "database" by fetching and organizing data from public APIs and managing it **exclusively on the client**, without a dedicated backend.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice working with real API data (users, posts, todos)
- Implement user-focused UI components
- Manage application state using React hooks
- Provide a seamless UX with live filtering, inline editing, and visual cues

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Users Dashboard**: Display all users sorted by ID  
- 🎯 **Visual Status**: Red border for users with incomplete todos, green for others  
- 🔍 **Live Search**: Filter users by name or email in real-time  
- 🧾 **"Other Data" Tooltip**: Hover reveals additional user info  
- ✏️ **Update/Delete**: Modify or remove user records directly in the UI  
- 📌 **User Selection**: View posts and todos for a selected user  
- 📝 **Add ToDos & Posts**: Add entries inline with cancel/confirm flow  
- 👤 **Add User**: Create new users via form interface (without "other data")
